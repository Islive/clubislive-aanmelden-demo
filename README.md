This setup contains all the necessary files to make a connection with our API and all the mandatory fields for a successfull registration.

Make contact with the API:
- in the folder /js/, you will find index.js. Here you can place your API key.
- Replace <JOUW API KEY> with the key you generated at VPS Cash.

Change styling:
- index.html is just an example. You can change all the HTML elements if you like. Want to use more DIVS? Go ahead. Include Bootstrap? No problem. The only mandatory fields are the input and label fields. 
- Would you like to add images? There is already a folder to fit your image needs. 

  DO-NOT:
  Change the names and ID's for the input and label elements. We need those unchanged to properly handle and validate the registration.

- In the folder /css/, you will find style.css. In here you can change/add/delete any ID or class you want. You can even rename the stylesheet if you like. If you do so, don't forget to update the new name in your style include. More stylesheets? Of course, it's yours now.

Ultimate customization:
- If you already have a website, you can just copy the form into your site. Don't forget to include index.js and api.js in your head tag. Only thing that's left is to give the form the proper styling to make it blend in with your site.
